Hey Guys

I am new to github and looking forward to uploding the codes of my new projects.
At the moment, I am writing my master thesis about digitalization in procurement. The scope will be on the identification of price drivers for our raw material and forecasting those accurate.

Due to the fact that I only have experiences in Python and httm, I will manly use Panda, Tensoflor and R.
I saw already some interessting codes and can not wait trying them by my self.

Feel free to write me anytime if you have recommendations or questions.

Bye
